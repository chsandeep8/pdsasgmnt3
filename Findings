a) After observing the bar graph we can clearly say that there is slight differnce between sample and population for the both mean and highest
b) When comparing 98th percentile of BMI i observed that there is clear difference between population and sample
c) after bootsraping we can clearly see that both sample and population of  Mean of Blood Pressure , standard deviation of BP are almost same and 95th percentile has little differnce still better than random sample vs population comparsion so this clearly 
shows that bootsrapping works better than random sampling to make a decision on data
